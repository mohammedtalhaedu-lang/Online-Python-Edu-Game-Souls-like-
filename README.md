## Overview

The Python Soulweaver is an interactive, game-based Python tutorial where you learn programming concepts through a dark fantasy narrative inspired by Souls-like games. Face challenging coding puzzles, battle epic bosses, and master Python—or lose everything and start over.

### Key Features

- **10 Progressive Levels**: From basic variables to advanced metaprogramming
- **4 Epic Boss Battles**: Face the Syntax Sentinel, Iterative Hydra, Object Archmage, and Void Compiler
- **Permadeath Mechanics**: Fail a challenge and restart from Level 1 (unless you use the ultimate ability!)
- **3 Hallowed Trinkets** (Special Abilities):
  -  **All-Seeing Eye**: Reveals the complete solution (3-level cooldown)
  -  **Warded Grimoire**: Provides hints and error lines (5-level cooldown)
  -  **Echo of the First Flame**: Prevents permadeath ONCE per game
- **Stunning Dark Fantasy UI**: Glassmorphism, particle effects, atmospheric animations
- **State Persistence**: Your progress is saved automatically
- **AI-Generated Boss Artwork**: Each boss has unique, atmospheric visuals

##  How to Play

### Controls

1. **Read the Challenge**: Each level presents a Python concept and coding task
2. **Write Code**: Use the Abyssal Compiler (code editor) to write your solution
3. **Submit**: Click "SUBMIT TO THE VOID" to test your code
4. **Use Abilities**: Activate Hallowed Trinkets when you need help
5. **Advance**: Successfully complete challenges to progress through all 10 levels

### Level Progression

| Level | Topic | Type |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Variables & Data Types | Normal |
| 2 | Basic Types (int, float, str, bool) | Normal |
| 3 | **BOSS: Conditional Logic (if/elif/else)** | **Boss** |
| 4 | Lists & Indexing | Normal |
| 5 | Dictionaries & Key-Value Pairs | Normal |
| 6 | **BOSS: Loops & Iteration** | **Boss** |
| 7 | Functions & Scope | Normal |
| 8 | Error Handling (try/except) | Normal |
| 9 | **BOSS: Object-Oriented Programming** | **Boss** |
| 10 | **FINAL BOSS: Decorators & Metaprogramming** | **Final Boss** |

### Permadeath System

 **WARNING**: This game features TRUE permadeath mechanics!

-  **Fail any challenge** → Reset to Level 1, lose all progress
-  **Echo of the First Flame** → Use ONCE to stay at your current level upon death
-  **Death counter tracks** your failures throughout the journey

##  Features

### Dark Fantasy Aesthetic

- **Color Palette**: Deep blacks, dark purples, crimson accents, glowing greens
- **Typography**: Cinzel (medieval headers), Source Code Pro (code), Crimson Text (body)
- **Effects**: 
  - Floating particle system (embers & code symbols)
  - Screen shake on boss encounters
  - Victory/death animations
  - Glassmorphism UI panels
  - Glowing, pulsing abilities

### Boss Encounters

##  Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Pure HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **Vanilla CSS3**: No frameworks, custom design system
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: No libraries or frameworks
- **LocalStorage API**: State persistence
- **Canvas API**: Particle effects

### Browser Compatibility

-  Chrome 90+
-  Firefox 88+
-  Edge 90+
-  Safari 14+

### Validation System

The game uses JavaScript-based validation to check your code. For each level:
1. Your code is checked for required elements (keywords, patterns, structure)
2. Success triggers level advancement and ability cooldown reduction
3. Failure triggers permadeath sequence

> **Note**: This is a teaching tool. A production version would integrate a real Python interpreter (e.g., Skulpt, Brython, or backend service).

##  Learning Outcomes

By completing The Python Soulweaver, you will master:

1.  Variables and data types
2.  Conditional logic and branching
3.  Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
4.  Loops and iteration (for, while, range)
5.  Functions and scope
6.  Error handling (try/except/finally)
7.  Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance)
8.  Advanced Python (decorators, generators, metaprogramming)

## 🎮 Tips for Success

1. **Read Carefully**: Boss battles have complex multi-part requirements
2. **Use Abilities Wisely**: They have long cooldowns!
3. **Save the Flame**: The Echo of First Flame is your ONLY safety net
4. **Experiment**: The code editor is live—try different approaches
5. **Learn from Death**: Each failure teaches you what NOT to do
